       AArrpp  manipulates  or  displays the kernel's IPv4 network neighbour cache. It can add
       entries to the table, delete one or display the current content.

       AARRPP stands for Address Resolution Protocol, which is used to find the  media  access
       control address of a network neighbour for a given IPv4 Address.

MMOODDEESS
       aarrpp with no mode specifier will print the current content of the table. It is possi‐
       ble to limit the number of entries printed, by specifying an hardware address  type,
       interface name or host address.

       aarrpp --dd _a_d_d_r_e_s_s will delete a ARP table entry. Root or netadmin privilege is required
       to do this. The entry is found by IP address. If a hostname is  given,  it  will  be
       resolved before looking up the entry in the ARP table.

       aarrpp  --ss  _a_d_d_r_e_s_s  _h_w___a_d_d_r  is  used  to  set up a new table entry. The format of the
       _h_w___a_d_d_r parameter is dependent on the hardware class, but for most classes  one  can
       assume  that  the usual presentation can be used.  For the Ethernet class, this is 6
       bytes in hexadecimal, separated by colons. When adding proxy arp  entries  (that  is
       those  with the ppuubblish flag set) a nneettmmaasskk may be specified to proxy arp for entire
       subnets. This is not good practice, but is supported by older kernels because it can
       be  useful.  If  the tteemmpp flag is not supplied entries will be permanent stored into
       the ARP cache. To simplify setting up entries for one of  your  own  network  inter‐
       faces,  you  can  use  the  aarrpp  --DDss  _a_d_d_r_e_s_s _i_f_n_a_m_e form. In that case the hardware
       address is taken from the interface with the specified name.

              Tell the user what is going on by being verbose.

       --nn,, ----nnuummeerriicc
              shows numerical addresses instead of trying to determine symbolic host,  port
              or user names.

       --HH _t_y_p_e, ----hhww--ttyyppee _t_y_p_e, --tt _t_y_p_e
              When  setting  or  reading  the  ARP cache, this optional parameter tells aarrpp
              which class of entries it should check for.  The default value of this param‐
              eter  is  eetthheerr  (i.e.  hardware  code  0x01 for IEEE 802.3 10Mbps Ethernet).
              Other values might include network technologies such  as  ARCnet  (aarrccnneett)  ,
              PROnet (pprroonneett) , AX.25 (aaxx2255) and NET/ROM (nneettrroomm).

       --aa     Use alternate BSD style output format (with no fixed columns).

       --ee     Use default Linux style output format (with fixed columns).

       --DD,, ----uussee--ddeevviiccee
              Instead  of  a  hw_addr, the given argument is the name of an interface.  aarrpp
              will use the MAC address of that interface for the table entry. This is  usu‐
              ally the best option to set up a proxy ARP entry to yourself.

       --ii _I_f, ----ddeevviiccee _I_f
              Select  an  interface.  When  dumping the ARP cache only entries matching the
              specified interface will be printed. When setting a  permanent  or  tteemmpp  ARP
              entry this interface will be associated with the entry; if this option is not
              used, the kernel will guess based on the routing table. For ppuubb  entries  the
              specified interface is the interface on which ARP requests will be answered.
              NNOOTTEE::  This  has to be different from the interface to which the IP datagrams
              will be routed.  NNOOTTEE:: As of kernel 2.2.0 it is no longer possible to set  an
              ARP entry for an entire subnet. Linux instead does automagic proxy arp when a
              route exists and it is forwarding. See aarrpp(7) for details. Also  the  ddoonnttppuubb
              option  which  is available for delete and set operations cannot be used with
              2.4 and newer kernels.

       --ff _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e, ----ffiillee _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Similar to the --ss option, only this time the address info is taken from  file
              _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.   This can be used if ARP entries for a lot of hosts have to be set
              up.  The name of the data file is very often _/_e_t_c_/_e_t_h_e_r_s,  but  this  is  not
              official. If no filename is specified _/_e_t_c_/_e_t_h_e_r_s is used as default.

              The  format  of  the file is simple; it only contains ASCII text lines with a
              hostname, and a hardware address separated by  whitespace.  Additionally  the
              ppuubb, tteemmpp and nneettmmaasskk flags can be used.

       In all places where a hhoossttnnaammee is expected, one can also enter an IIPP aaddddrreessss in dot‐
       ted-decimal notation.

       As a special case for compatibility the order  of  the  hostname  and  the  hardware
       address can be exchanged.

       Each  complete  entry  in  the  ARP  cache will be marked with the CC flag. Permanent
       entries are marked with MM and published entries have the PP flag.

       This will answer ARP requests for 10.0.0.2 on eth0 with the MAC address for eth1.

       Delete the ARP table entry for 10.0.0.1 on interface eth1. This will match published
       proxy ARP entries and permanent entries.
